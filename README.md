# Stores

Given the available restaurants, display them based on their status [open, order, closed ], apply filters and also the user should be able to search by name.

## Future Iimprovements

- Have more refined use case to resolve the filtering and fetching data
- Use more states to propagate data to the UI level
- Improve the Spinner for filtering, if the app is multi language, that component can be improved
- Create a string provider to handle the previous point in the viewModel level
